Let's say you want to write a program that adds two numbers. Something like
this:

```python
1 + 2 # => 3
```

If you type `1 + 2` into Repl.it's terminal (which is on the right side), you
can see this:

<details>
<summary>

What does "#=>" mean?

</summary>

When you write python code, everything after the "#" sign is not used. When the
computer goes to run the code, it just disregards it. In other words, it is a
note specifically meant for a human who's reading the code.

On this site, we'll be using "#" to mention things about the code, and "# => "
to show what the code does when it's executed.

</details>

Repl.it shows you the answer. Great! But, we need a way to make this changeable.
We don't want a program which __only__ shows the number 3! So, what do we do? 

In programming, we use **variables**.

Just like how in maths, we can use a letter to represent a number:

    x + 8 = 10

    so x = 2

We can use variables in computer science to represent **anything**:

```python
name = "ori"
age = 15
glasses = True
```

Then, just like how we saw the evaluation of `1 + 2` by typing it into the
right-hand side of the repl.it screen, we can type in a variable's **name** to
see what is stored inside the variable, like this:

```python
name = "ori"

name # => 'ori'
```

Here it is in a picture:

**NOTE:** Make sure to put `"` around any text. You'll understand why that's
important later in this lesson, so don't panic!

### Until now

So, we've found a way for the computer to:

  * store a value, then
  * get it back later.

**That is what a variable is!**

We can think of a variable of a box. We give the box a name, and put something
inside it. Later on, we can get the thing inside the box using the box's name.

![Storing a value inside a box](https://i.imgur.com/ReD1zn1.png)

### Why use variables?

Let's look at a complicated calculation like this one:

```python
(1 + 2) * (2 - 1) * (2 + 2)
```

(`*` means "multiply" in Python)

If we type this into Repl.it, we get `12`.

But, now instead of 1 and 2, let's use a different set of values. Like, say, 3
and 4. Bummer, we have to re-write the entire calculation! This is going to take
forever, especially if we are repeating this calculation many times.

               NOTE TO OHAD: please translate "Bummer" to באסה :)

Variables can help us here!

Instead of using the _actual_ values, we can just use the _boxes_, then swap out
the values however we want.


In Repl.it, type in a value for `a` and `b`:

```python
a = (YOUR NUMBER HERE)
b = (YOUR NUMBER HERE)
```

then paste the following to see the result:

```
(a + b) * (b - a) * (b + b)
```

![result using a = 2, b = 5, result is 210](https://i.imgur.com/5OfAgER.png)

We can change `a` and `b` to whatever you want to get a solution for any values.
Amazing!!!

Question:
  On which side of the = sign do you put the name of the variable?

Answer 1:  On the left
Answer 2:  On the right                                                  CORRECT
Answer 3:  In the middle


Question:
  What's the difference between calculating 8.0 + 2 against 8 + 2 (you can type
  this into the Repl.it terminal)

Answer 1:  The first gives 10.0, the second gives 10                     CORRECT
Answer 2:  They both give the same answer, 10
Answer 3:  They both give the same answer, 10.0

                                END NOTE TO OHAD


How does this work?
-------------------

Let's say that you want to save a massive list of people's heights. You want to
have their name (so you can identify them) as well as their height. The way you
might save this information is using a table:

| person | height |
|--------|-------:|
| ori    | 1.5    |
| yanai  | 1.6    |
| roey   | 1.6    |
| ohad   | 1.8    |

Now, when we want to see a specific person's height, we can just look at the
table. Say we want to find Ohad's height:

| | |
|----|----:|
|ohad | 1.8 |

We know that it's 1.8m.

Note that we can't go the other way. We can't look at the height and find the
person as there are many different people with the same height:

| | |
|----|----:|
| yanai  | 1.6    |
| roey   | 1.6    |

We can't go backwards.

This is the same way that a computer stores variables!

| Variable name   | Value   |
|-----------------|--------:|
| x               | 10      |
| name            | Ori     |
| age             | 16      |

This is called a **symbol table**. It stores other things that aren't variables,
too, but for now we only care about the variables.

Question:
  When storing a variable, we need its name to stay the same.

### One thing before we keep going

So far, we've been using the Repl.it terminal (bit on the right). This means
that we have to type in what we want again and again. Instead, we can use the
left side of Repl.it to write code, then run it using the green "run" button at
the top of the screen.

![Run button](https://i.imgur.com/c2Srepi.png)

For example, we can type in the code we were writing earlier:

![Put code from earlier in left](https://i.imgur.com/zhPoUAN.png)

but now, when we press "Run", we don't see anything!

When writing a Python program, you have to do the following to make the computer
__show you__ the result:

```python
print() # Type what you want to show inside the ()

print(5)
print("hello")

a = 2
print(a)

print(a + 5)
```

We'll go over how this works in a later lesson, but for now, **try it out
yourself!**

To show the code we wrote earlier:

```python
a = 2
b = 5

print((a + b) * (b - a) * (b + b))
```

Variable types
--------------

So far, we've been writing either:

  * numbers (`5`), or
  * strings (`"ori"`)

When assigning values to strings (text), we have to put `"` around the text. We
don't have to do that for numbers, so why do we do it?

Python can't tell if you're writing text or code. We have to put `"` around the
text so that python doesn't just run it as code!

Note the difference in this example:

```python
print(print)
print("print")
```

For the first one, Python will think you're talking about the code which shows
you values on the right side of the screen. For the second, it'll think you're
talking about some text that you want to show to your user.

That's why it's important to put `"` around your text.

Operators
---------

We're going to focus mostly on numbers this lesson. What can you do with
numbers? Do operations on them!

We can add using the `+` operator:

```python
print(1 + 2)
```

We can subract using the `-` operator:

```python
print(1 - 2)
print(5 - 10)
```

We can multiply using the `*` operator:

```python
print(3 * 23)
```

You haven't seen this before, but we can find the remainder of a division using
the `%` operator.

```python
print(10 % 5) # 10 divided by 5 is 2 with no remainder
print(10 % 3) # 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1
print(10 % 2) # 10 divided by 2 is 5 with no remainder
```

Note that you can find if a value is divisible by another value if their modulo
is `0`.

For example:

```python
a = 5987643
b = 1995881

print(a % b) # 0, so a divided by b is a whole number
```

We can divide using the `/` operator:

```python
print(41160 / 98)
```

**Wait!** When we divide, we don't just get a value, we get a value with a `.0`
at the end! What's happening here??

This is a new variable type, **float**.

Floats are numbers which have decimal points at the end. For example:

```python
15.2
0.001
10.0
```

All of these are floats.

Computers need to store these numbers in a special way. They need to store the
number, as well as the parts after the decimal point. This means they take up
more space in the computer, so, we try to not use floats unless necessary for
calculations.

                      THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR MEDIA
